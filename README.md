Overview

SwiftCare Backend is the server-side component of the SwiftCare application, built using Python. This backend is responsible for managing data, handling business logic, and providing APIs for the frontend (e.g., mobile applications, web interfaces) to interact with. It aims to provide a robust and scalable foundation for the SwiftCare ecosystem, focusing on [**Insert a brief, compelling description of SwiftCare's purpose here, e.g., efficient healthcare management, seamless patient-doctor communication, etc.**].

This README provides essential information for developers looking to understand, set up, and contribute to the SwiftCare Backend project.

Features

Here's a glimpse of the key features implemented in the SwiftCare Backend:

* User Authentication and Authorization: Securely manages user accounts, logins, and access permissions.
* Patient Management: Allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of patient records.
* Appointment Scheduling: Enables users to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
* Medical Record Management: Provides storage and retrieval of patient medical history, reports, and prescriptions.
* Real-time Notifications: Facilitates timely alerts and updates to users.
* API Endpoints: Offers a well-defined set of RESTful APIs for seamless communication with frontend applications.
* Database Integration: Persists application data using Supabase.

## Technologies Used

The SwiftCare Backend is built using the following technologies:

* Python:The primary programming language.
* [Framework 1, e.g., Django]:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the API.
* **[Framework 2, e.g., Django REST Framework]:** A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs with Django.
* **[Database, e.g., PostgreSQL]** The relational database used for data storage.
* **[ORM/ODM, e.g., Django ORM or SQLAlchemy]:** Used for interacting with the database.
* **[Dependency Management, e.g., pip]:** Python package installer.
* **[Testing Framework, e.g., pytest]:** Used for writing and running unit and integration tests.
* **[Other Libraries/Tools, e.g., Celery for task queuing, Redis for caching]:** List any other significant libraries or tools.

Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the SwiftCare Backend on your local machine for development or testing.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python: Version 3.8 or higher. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* pip: Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
* [Database Client, e.g., PostgreSQL client tools if using PostgreSQL]:** Install the necessary client for your chosen database.
* [Other Dependencies, if any, e.g., Redis server if using Redis]:** Install any other required services.

Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd swiftcare-backend
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Configure the database:
    Create a database named `swiftcare` (or your preferred name) in your database system.
    Update the database connection settings in the project's configuration file (e.g., `settings.py` in Django). This usually involves specifying the database engine, name, user, password, and host.

5.  Run database migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  Create a superuser (if applicable, e.g., for Django admin):
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The backend server should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (or a similar address).

API Endpoints

For example:

| Endpoint          | Method | Description                                  |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/users/`     | POST   | Register a new user                          |
| `/api/login/`     | POST   | Authenticate a user and obtain an access token |
| `/api/patients/`  | GET    | Retrieve a list of all patients              |
| `/api/patients/{id}/` | GET    | Retrieve details of a specific patient       |
| `/api/appointments/` | POST   | Create a new appointment                     |


Testing

The SwiftCare Backend includes a suite of tests to ensure code quality and reliability. To run the tests:

1.  Ensure you have the necessary testing dependencies installed (usually included in `requirements.txt`).
2.  Execute the test runner:
    ```bash
    pytest  # If using pytest
    # Or, if using Django's test runner:
    python manage.py test
    ```

    Review the test output to ensure all tests pass.
